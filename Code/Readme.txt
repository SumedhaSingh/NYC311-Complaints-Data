Team contribution
We worked in a team of two members:
1. Sumedha Singh
2. Vishal Manghnani
During the initial phase of the project, we came up with different ideas to work on the project. Out of which we decided to move forward with one of the many ideas. We both encouraged each other to share and come up with useful ideas to help with the progress of the project. Both the team members helped each other with the individual knowledge and skills without any prompting. Both the team members devoted equal number of hours towards working on the project. Weekly contribution to the project and discussions helped us reach the final outcome.
